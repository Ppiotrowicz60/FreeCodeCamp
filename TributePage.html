          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The Volvo C70 is a two-door, four-passenger sport compact
            manufactured and marketed by Volvo Cars from 1996 to 2013 across two
            generations. The first generation (1996–2005) was available as both
            a coupé (1996–2002) and softtop convertible (1997–2005). The second
            generation (2006–2013) was available as a retractable hardtop
            convertible.

          <h2>First generation (1996-2005)</h2>
          <p>
            Volvo debuted the first generation C70 at the 1996 Paris Motor Show,
            and introduced it in Europe as a 1997 model, and a year later as a
            1998 model in North America — with 2.0 (sold mostly in Italy), a
            low-pressure turbo (2.4L) and a high-pressure turbo (2.0L and 2.3L),
            5-cylinder, turbocharged petrol engines and manual and automatic
            transmissions. Peter Horbury designed the exterior and Mexican
            designer Jose Diaz de la Vega led the interior design team. The C70
            broke Volvo's decades-long styling tradition of boxy, rectilinear
            designs and was Volvo's first luxury coupe since the 780. According
            to Peter Horbury, Volvo's design chief from 1991 to 2002, with the
            C70, Volvo threw away the box, but "kept the toy inside!" "Our
            vision was to design a convertible that would meet the needs of a
            family of four looking for comfortable blue-sky motoring in a
            vehicle also providing stylish looks, performance and faultless
            driving and road-holding." In a development program of 30 months and
            working with a Volvo 850-derived platform, Britain’s TWR (Tom
            Walkinshaw Racing) co-designed the car's basic design and suspension
            tuning with Volvo. Manufacture of the C70 was a joint venture until
            the two companies experienced disputes that threatened to interrupt
            production; TWR did not contribute to the second generation C70.
            Volvo's first modern convertible, the C70 was manufactured in
            Uddevalla, Sweden on a separate assembly line from the 70-series
            sedan and station wagon. The four-seater convertible featured an
            electrically heated glass rear window, automatic (pop-up) rollover
            hoops system ROPS, seat belt pre-tensioners, boron steel reinforced
            A-pillars, front and side airbags, and a safety cage — a
            horseshoe-like structure around the passenger compartment. The cloth
            convertible top, initially available in four colors, was fully
            automatic, operated by a single, dashboard-mounted button. The top
            stored automatically under an integral rigid tonneau cover in a
            system pioneered in modern convertibles with the fourth generation
            Mercedes SL. The C70 convertible exhibited two negative traits
            endemic to convertibles: poor rear visibility and pronounced scuttle
            shake, a characteristic whereby the structural design of the
            bulkhead between engine and passenger compartment of a convertible
            suffers sufficiently poor rigidity to negatively impact ride and
            handling, allowing noticeable vibration, shudder or chassis-flexing
            into the passenger compartment. Early special editions featured
            two-tone leather interior with wood trim and a SC-901 (1998) Dolby
            Pro Logic I stereo with 3-disc integrated changer unit (via a
            cartridge) 400 watts of power and 11 high end Dynaudio speakers.

          <h2>Second generation (2006–2013)</h2>
          <p>
            The second generation C70 model debuted at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor
            Show, sharing the Volvo S40 platform, designed by John Kinsey and
            built by Pininfarina Sverige AB — a joint venture between
            Pininfarina and Volvo (and the first time Pininfarina has
            manufactured outside Italy). The C70 retractable hardtop replaces
            its predecessors two models: both the convertible and the coupé, the
            latter which had been absent from Volvo's lineup since 2003. The
            retractable hardtop went on sale in the U.S. in spring 2006. The
            Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in the United States
            conducted its first crash tests of several convertibles, designating
            the C70 a "Top Safety Pick".
